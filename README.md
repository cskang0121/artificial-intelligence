## CS420-artificial-intelligence (Assignment Description)

This repository contains my course works for CS420 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

The first 3 questions of Assignement 1 focus on the concept of conditional independence in Bayesian Network and its real life application. For question 4, I created an artificial neural-based classifier to classify the k_mnist dataset which is available [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/kmnist) (more details about the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist)). The ultimate goal of this task is to achieve an overall accuracy of >80% and have a thorough understanding of how a dense artificial neural network (ANN) works. For question 5, I learned how to perform transfer learning in the context of convolutional neural network (CNN). A pre-trained model called "MobileNetV2" is used to execute image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset (more information on the dataset is available [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)). The goal is to design an CNN that achieve >85% accuracy after training.
